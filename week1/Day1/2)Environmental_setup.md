# **Environment Setup**

Before starting the workshop, you need to prepare the workspace and download the required resources.

---

### **Setup Steps**

1. **Create a Folder Named `VSD`**  
    This will serve as the main workspace for all workshop files.
    
   ```bash
   mkdir VSD
   ```
    
3. **Open a Terminal Inside the `VSD` Folder**  
    Navigate into the folder to make sure all future files are saved here.
    
   ```bash
   cd VSD
   ```
    
4. **Clone the Workshop Repository**  
    Download the repository that contains the RTL design and synthesis materials:
    
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
    ```
