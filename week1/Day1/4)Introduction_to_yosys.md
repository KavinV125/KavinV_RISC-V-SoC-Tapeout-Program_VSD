# **Yosys â€“ RTL to Netlist**

---

### **1. What is a Synthesizer?**

- A **synthesizer** is a tool that converts a **Register Transfer Level (RTL) design** into a **gate-level netlist**.
    
- In this workshop, we use **Yosys** as the synthesizer.

### **2. Netlist File**

- A **netlist** represents the RTL design in terms of **logic gates, interconnections, and primary inputs/outputs**.
    
- High-level RTL constructs (like `always` blocks or `if` conditions) are no longer present.
    
- This gate-level netlist is the **output generated by Yosys**.

### **3. Verifying the Netlist**

- Once synthesis is complete, the **netlist can be simulated using iVerilog**.
    
- This ensures that the synthesized version behaves the same as the original RTL.
    
- The **same testbench** used for RTL simulation can also be used to test the netlist.

### **4. Key Point**

> The **primary inputs and outputs** remain unchanged between the RTL and the synthesized netlist.  
> Hence, you can use the **same testbench** for both RTL verification and netlist verification.
